# InsightIQ Postman Collections
Welcome to the Postman Collections Quickstart Guide! If you're looking for a quick and easy way to get started with the InsightIQ API with no additional code, this is the place for you. [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/product/api-client) is a great tool that allows users explore API functionality by manually sending API requests and receiving responses. We have created a collection of pre-populated HTTP requests that can be sent to the InsightIQ API. This quickstart is a step-by-step guide that will get you up and running with Postman and the Postman [collection](https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/collections/intro-to-collections/) to enable you for ad-hoc exploration and testing.

If you are looking for a more in-depth guide and reference for the InsightIQ API, please refer to the [InsightIQ API documentation](https://docs.insightiq.com).

4. Once both the collection and the environment variables are imported into Postman, see the [Configuration](https://github.com/insightiq-ai/insightiq-postman#configuration) section on how to correctly configure API keys with the collection.

### Configuration
The InsightIQ Postman collection uses [Postman environment variables](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/intro_to_environments_and_globals/) to simplify each API request. More information on managing Postman environments can be found at [Setting up an environment with variables](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/environments_and_globals/manage_environments/).
